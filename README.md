# Cantonal Project - Linear Programming

The Cantonal Projects have a budget of CHF 1'000'000 for the development of 8 projects. It is not possible to develop 
all of them, so it must be decided how to split the budget between the projects and which ones to exclude from development.

Because not all projects can be developed the commission added the following conditions: at least one project regarding 
the renewable energy needs to be developed, maximum one project per company can be developed and project 1 must receive 
the funds.
